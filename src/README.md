Created a User card grid layout having a navbar with a button stating " GET USER ".

There are three components used here, they are Navbar, Bouncer, Cards which are used to display header, loader and users respectively.

Made the Header fixed so it doesnt scroll up while scrolling down.

used hooks like usestate and useEffect for setting datas and to control loader.

used setTimeout function to adjust the delay and present it as if the system is making delays while fetching datas 

used an external API to fetch data and dislpay users

Added " DEVELOPER " as an extra detail to make it more presentable.

used my own css for styling the webpage to my-vision.
